This Python script will download PDF files from https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc and store transactions in \the local SQLLITE database. 

Many PDF files are corrupted at the government site, so the data set is incomplete. However, it can still be used to track one of the best stock traders out there, Nancy Pelosi.
